___

Environment for modeling real-life mechanic physical processes on the computer. At this moment you can choose between two different mechanical models - inclined plane and free falling. Both of them offer to change parameters of environment and body. Below I will describe them in more detail.

## Free fall
The interface is divided into separate panels -  Body control panel, Time control panel and Back to menu panel. The Body control allows setting the required height in meters and mass in kilograms. The upper button on the time panel stops or resumes global time. Buttons below control stopwatch. Checkmark determines need or not to automatically stop the  timer when the mechanical body touches the main plane. It can be useful when you need an accurate result.

## Inclined plane
In addition to the above panels, the model of the inclined plane has a Plane control panel. The first three fields - length, width, height describes the scale of the plane. Friction - a field with a value between 0 and 1 - represents the corresponding force. Below you can set the needed angle in degrees.
